# SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Practices 

## `Sitemap`

A sitemap is made in XML (Extensible Markup Language) and is primarily used as a way for AI to index your site easier. Search engines like Google use XML sitemaps to store your siteâ€™s pages more efficiently, producing better results when people search for related terms.

- **Sitemap URL:** https://kdev.app/sitemap.xml

- **Posted Sitemap on Google Search Console:** https://search.google.com/search-console/about

## `Google Search Console`

Google Search Console is a web service by Google which allows webmasters to check indexing status, search queries, crawling errors and optimize visibility of their websites.

* Log into account -> Enter domain name of website -> Copy TXT record into the DNS configuration for https://kdev.app/ in Firebase

* Once sitemap.xml is created go to -> Sitemaps tab -> Add a new sitemap URL and it should be good to go 

## `Robots.txt`

A robots.txt file tells search engines what your website's rules of engagement are. A big part of doing SEO is about sending the right signals to search engines, and the robots.txt is one of the ways to communicate your crawling preferences to search engines.
